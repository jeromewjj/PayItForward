## Problem Statement
Our team CodeMonkeys have chosen the following problem statement:

Giving Back
Whilst Singapore is considered a developed nation, there are still many who are less fortunate than others. How can we embrace inclusivity and integrate people who might otherwise be excluded or marginalised?

## Our App
PayItForward is a mobile payment application which aims to encourage users to donate a small amount of money everytime they make a payment. PayItForward aims to work with different merchants to allow users to donate to the merchants when users make a payment. This donation will then be used by users who are financially needy to make payment to the merchants. 

## Features

### Home Page
PayItForward allows users to view the total amount they have donated. Users can also view their ranking.

### Payment Page
PayItForward allows users to round up their payment and the excess will be donated to the different merchants. Registered users who are financially needy can also use the same payment application and the donation made can be used to offset the payment.

### Donation Page
PayItForward allows users to directly donate certain amount they want.

### History Page
PayItForward allows users to view their past transactions and the amount they have donated.
